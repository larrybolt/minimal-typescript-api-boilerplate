<h1 align="center">Minimal Typescript API Boilerplate</h1>
<p align="center">
  <b>A very minimal RESTful API boilerplate powered by TypeScript, TypeORM and routing-controllers.</b></br>

## Why another one?

Like always the ones out there didn't fit my need so I wanted to reinvent the wheel.
Also each one I tried didn't work out of the box.

## What's in here

- **Databases made easier** with the help of ORM [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
- **Validation and swagger docs generation using annotations** thanks to [class-validator](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator) and [custom-validation-classes](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator#custom-validation-classes).
- **Dependency Injection** provided by [TypeDI](https://github.com/pleerock/typedi).
- **API Documentation** like as good as automatically generated can be with [swagger](http://swagger.io/).
- **Routing for controllers using annotations** with [routing-controllers](https://github.com/pleerock/routing-controllers).
